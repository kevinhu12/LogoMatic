# LogoMatic

A program that harnesses the power of OpenAI to provide detailed, custom-made logo designs from a given prompt. Here's how it works!

**Step 1: Provide a prompt** <br /> <br/>

**Step 2: Relax away while LogoMatic generates your logo!** <br /> <br />

### Sentiment Analysis

LogoMatic also supports basic sentiment analysis by leveraging the EdenAI natural language processing API. While generating the logo, the program will display a message to accomodate the user's attitude.

**A positive attitude will yield an enthusiastic and engaged response.**
Sample: A basketball team called the Comets. Thank you! <br /> <br />
![sample-positive](https://github.com/kevinhu12/LogoMatic/assets/67344175/2e800841-05c1-4590-9667-8e90f2670025)

**A negative attitude will yield an empathetic and patient response.**
Sample: A basketball team called the Comets, even though you always take so long to respond. <br /> <br />
![sample-negative](https://github.com/kevinhu12/LogoMatic/assets/67344175/4a816e49-01b5-4265-bebb-3c4225a282f8)

**A neutral attitude will yield a formal response.**
Sample: A basketball team called the Comets. <br /> <br />
