### Sentiment Analysis

LogoMatic also supports basic sentiment analysis by leveraging the EdenAI natural language processing API. While generating the logo, the program will display a message to accomodate the user's attitude.

**A positive attitude will yield an enthusiastic and engaged response.**
Prompt: A basketball team called the Comets. Thank you!
![Sample Positive](https://github.com/k57hu/LogoMatic/blob/master/images/sample-positive.png?raw=true)

**A negative attitude will yield an empathetic and patient response.**
Prompt: A basketball team called the Comets, even though you always take so long to respond.
![Sample Negative](https://github.com/k57hu/LogoMatic/blob/master/images/sample-negative.png?raw=true)

**A neutral attitude will yield a formal response.**
Prompt: A basketball team called the Comets.
